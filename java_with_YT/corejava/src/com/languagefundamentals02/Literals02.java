/*    Literal is a constant value, and it is of some type, and we call it as a type of literal, in short the literal says the which type does the value or object belongs to, and we can explain better with an example;
        example: a = 10;
        here 'a' is a variable and 10 is the value of a and 10 is of which type of data? - it is of number type so for number type we say it as an integer, so we use data type called int;
        int a = 10;
        and here the 10 is the integer literal;
        similarly;
        float b = 11.1f;
        11.1f is the floating point literal;
        String = "tarun";
        "tarun" is of String literal;
