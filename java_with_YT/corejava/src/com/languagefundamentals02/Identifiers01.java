/*    identifiers are the names used to identify the various elements such as package, class, variables, methods...;
      examples: in this source code if we observe there are 9 identifiers;
      1. languagefundamentals is an identifier for package;
      2. class name Identifiers is an identifier for class;
      3. main is the variable identifier of main method;
      4. String is a class, so it is a class identifier;
      5. args is a variable identifier;
      6. System is a class, so it is a class identifier;
      7. out is a variable  identifier;
      8. print is a method variable;
      9. com is also a folder variable;

      there are rules while writing identifiers, and this is called naming conventions they are: ;
      rule 1: identifiers can consist of a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9,_,$;

      rule 2: identifier must start with a letter(LC (or) UC) or _ or $;
      examples: myname, MYNAME, _myage, $dollar --> these are allowed;

      rule 3: it cannot start with digits, and should not contain any special characters except underscore(_) and dollar($);
      examples: 2myname, #myage, .dollar --> not allowed;

      rule 4: no white spaces are allowed;
      examples: my name, my age --> not allowed instead of space we use underscore(_);

      rule 5: we cannot use reserve words of java as identifiers;
      examples: enum, new, for, while, static, final --> not allowed;

      rule 6: identifiers are case-sensitive;
      example: myname, Myname --> these two are different identifiers;

      camel case convention: the first letter of the first word of the identifier is in lowercase and subsequent words starts with uppercase letter we follow this convention for variables names and function names;
      example: myName, myAge --> good practice;

      pascal case convention: the first and subsequent words of the identifier starts with uppercase this convention is used for class name;
      example: MyName, MyAge --> good practice;
